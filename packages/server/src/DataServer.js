/**
 * Interface for a Bubble server.
 * 
 * Implement this class and pass to a Guardian.  Client requests will only be passed to this 
 * DataServer if they are valid and the user has the appropriate permissions.
 */
 // 
 // General Requirements:
 //
 //   [req-ds-gen-1] The data server shall reject any method call with an `INVALID_OPTION` error if it
 //                  detects the user has passed an invalid option.
 //
 // Notes:
 //
 //   1) A DataServer is protected by a Guardian.  The guardian enforces all access permissions and will only
 //      call the DataServer methods if the user has the appropriate permissions.  Therefore, the implementor
 //      must unconditionally service each method call and only reject if the requirements explicitly state it
 //      or the call could not be serviced due to an internal problem with the DataServer.
 //
 //   2) Where these requirements refer to rejecting with an error, this should be interpreted as a BubbleError.
 //      The error code given in these requirements is found in `@bubble-protocol/core/ErrorCodes` with a prefix
 //      of `BUBBLE_SERVER_ERROR_`.
 //
 //   3) For user-defined errors, please use the BubbleError class and either the BUBBLE_SERVER_INTERNAL_ERROR
 //      code or your own codes in the range reserved for user-defined data server errors (see 
 //      `@bubble-protocol/core/errors.js`).
 //
 //   4) Each method's `options` parameter is passed unfiltered from the client.  Implementors are free to add
 //      any additional options that suit the data storage service being provided.

  //
  // Requirements:
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-1] When called, the data server shall resolve with an array containing the listing of the given 
  //                 file or directory, with an entry for each sub-file if the given file is a directory (see
  //                 requirements [req-ds-ls-5] onwards)
  //              
  //   [req-ds-ls-2] The data server shall reject with a FILE_DOES_NOT_EXIST error if the file or directory
  //                 does not exist and the silent option is NOT given.
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-3] The data server shall resolve with an empty array if the file does not exist but the silent 
  //                 option is given.

  //   [req-ds-ls-4] The data server shall reject with a `BUBBLE_DOES_NOT_EXIST` error if the 
  //                 bubble does not exist on the server (regardless of any `silent` option).
  //
  // Listing Format:
  //
  //   Example bubble directory structure referred to in the requirements:
  //
  //   ```
  //   ROOT_PATH
  //    |- 0x0000..0001   (file)
  //    |- 0x0000..0002   (file)
  //    |- 0x0000..0003   (dir)
  //        |- fileA.txt
  //        |- fileB.mp4
  //   ```
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-5] The type of each listing entry shall be a plain object.
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-6] Each entry shall contain a `name` field (type `string`) with the name of the file or directory 
  //                 as it would be presented in the file's content id - i.e. <file-or-directory-id>[/path-extension].
  //                   Example: `name: '0x0000..0003/fileA.txt'`
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-7] Each entry shall contain a `type` field (type `string`) indicating whether it is a file or 
  //                 directory - either 'file' or 'dir'.
  //                   Example: `type: 'file'`
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-8] If the `long` and/or `length` option is given, each entry shall contain a `length` field (type 
  //                 `number`) with the length of the file in bytes, or, if the file is a directory, the number of 
  //                 files within the directory.
  //                   Example: `length: 72387467`
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-9] If the `long` and/or `created` option is given, each entry shall contain a `created` field (type 
  //                 `number`) with the integer UNIX timestamp (in milliseconds) of the time the file or directory was 
  //                 first created on the server.
  //                   Example: `created: 1683455053023`
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-10] If the `long` and/or `modified` option is given, each entry shall contain a `modified` field (type 
  //                  `number`) with the integer UNIX timestamp (in milliseconds) of the time the file or directory
  //                  contents was last modified on the server.
  //                   Example: `modified: 1683455053023`
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-11] A file is considered `modified` if it's contents are changed.
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-12] A directory (including the bubble's ROOT_PATH) is considered `modified` if any new files are added
  //                  or deleted (not when files are modified). 
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-13] If the file is a directory and the `directoryOnly` option is given, the listing shall contain
  //                  only the entry for the directory itself, not it's contents.  (Note, i.e. this is equivalent to 
  //                  `ls -d` on a unix system).
  //                    Example: `[{ name: '0x0000..0003', type: 'dir', length: 2, ... }]`
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-14] If the file is the bubble's root directory (as given by the special file id in
  //                  `@bubble-protocol/core/ROOT_PATH`), the data server shall interpret this as a request to list the 
  //                  bubble's root directory.  (I.e., unless [req-ds-ls-13] applies, list all files and directories in 
  //                  the root excluding any files within sub-directories).
  //                    Example: 
  //                      ```
  //                      [
  //                        { name: '0x0000..0001', type: 'file', length: 1024, ... },
  //                        { name: '0x0000..0002', type: 'file', length: 72387467, ... },
  //                        { name: '0x0000..0003', type: 'dir', length: 2, ... }
  //                      ]
  //                      ```
  //
  // Filtering:
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-15] If the `after` option is given, the listing shall be filtered to contain only files and
  //                  directories MODIFIED after (but not on) the option's timestamp (integer UNIX timestamp in ms).
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-16] If the `before` option is given, the listing shall be filtered to contain only files and
  //                  directories MODIFIED before (but not on) the option's timestamp (integer UNIX timestamp in ms).
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-17] If the `createdAfter` option is given, the listing shall be filtered to contain only files and
  //                  directories CREATED after (but not on) the option's timestamp (integer UNIX timestamp in ms).
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-18] If the `createdBefore` option is given, the listing shall be filtered to contain only files and
  //                  directories CREATED before (but not on) the option's timestamp (integer UNIX timestamp in ms).
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-19] If the `matches` option is given, the listing shall be filtered to contain only files and
  //                  directories whose name (see [req-ds-ls-6]) matches the regular expression given by the option.
  //
  //   [req-ds-ls-20] If multiple filters (i.e. from requirements [req-ds-ls-15]..[req-ds-ls-19]) are given, the data 
  //                  server shall apply all those given to the listing.
